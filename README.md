# virus-house
Recopilation of malware saved for research purposes that I found on the Internet in the late 2000s and early 2010s.


# Usage
Probably they will not work on modern systems, but since I have not tested them I can not ensure that are harmless. Because of that, you need to handle them as if they are dangerous, active malware. Some of them way be worms so they will try to spread out.

If you want to try them anyway, you must do it in a VM with no internet connection.

# Disclaimer
The purpose of this repo is to allow the study of malware and enable people who are interested in malware analysis to have access to old malware.

Only execute them in isolated controlled environments, otherwise you could infect your machine and others. 

I am not responsible for any harm or data loss that may come with the usage of these malwares. 

# Roadmap
I have published the malware but I have no intention of maintaining this project. But if I had to be the maintainer I would do the following:
1. Testing the malware and documenting its effects, procedence, AV reports, binary analysis...
2. Ciphering the binaries for safer storage in GitHub and presumably and better compatibility (better tolerancy...) with AV software.
3. Classifying the malware: For example: trojans, worms, jokes, adwares, ransomwares... The classification itself is a thing that needs to be well thought, as well as what distinguishes this project from other similar projects.
4. Merging / contributing the interesting malware that would be already documented and tested to bigger malware library projects such as [theZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) or [MalwareDatabase](https://github.com/Endermanch/MalwareDatabase).

Which means that this repo is looking for a maintainer and pull requests are welcome!
